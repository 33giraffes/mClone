==== Description

A quick minecraft clone i created. You must have Ursina game engine installed for it to work.
A world is 15x15x15 blocks. When you first enter into the game, you will be loaded into a default world.

If it wont run, type this command into cmd: python -m pip install ursina

==== Run mClone

1. Put all files/folders in main directory in the same directory.
2. double click mClone.bat

==== Controls

Press WASD and space to move, left and right click to break blocks, middle click to select a block.
Press f to fly, space and shift to go up and down.
Esc opens the UI, where you can save the world, load another one, or exit the game. there is no warning 
  in case you load a world without saving your world.
  
Use the number keys to select from 10 different blocks: grass, dirt, stone, brick, wood, planks, leaves,
   glass, sand, and bedrock.

==== Notes

There are a few bugs due to how Ursina game engine works; please feel free to give me suggestions on how
   to solve them should you encounter any of them.
To delete a world, go to the worlds folder and delete the folder with the name of your world.
   [!] Do not delete the .default folder

feel free to ask me any questions should i have left anythong out.

This project began when i watched the video 'Code minecraft with python in 57 seconds'
the video link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tONNC-bWSFM

All code in that video is used in my project; credit to Beau Cames.

The rest of the code is completely me, with a little bit of help from Gemini; no code, just helping me 
   understand Ursina.
